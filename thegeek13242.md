# Theft Detection system for luggage when in Train

## Summary
We all have been in a situation when we are travelling alone in a train during night and you are always worried about your luggage of theft or leaving it behind. 
So I want to build a device so that we can place it in the luggage and whenever we go out of range of that device the buzzer rings in the luggage as well as in the mobile phone.

## Plan
- I will preferablly use Raspberry Pi 4 for this project because it already has built in Bluetooth and Wifi Module so I can experiment with that easily.
- In the first phase I will most probably use 2 Raspberry Pi 4 board to connect them with each other whenever either of them goes out of range I will ring the buzzers on both of the boards.
- Then I will develop a basic Android app so that it can just work with one Raspberry Pi 4 module.
- I am also planning to put SIM card module & GPS module so that even if the luggage gets left behind its location is still available to us.

## Budget
